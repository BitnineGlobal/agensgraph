# Note: Darwin is the original code name for macOS, also known as OS X.
# We still use "darwin" as the port name, partly because config.guess does.

# Select appropriate semaphore support.  Darwin 6.0 (macOS 10.2) and up
# support System V semaphores; before that we have to use named POSIX
# semaphores, which are less good for our purposes because they eat a
# file descriptor per backend per max_connection slot.
