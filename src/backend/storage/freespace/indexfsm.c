 * NOTES:
 *
 *	This is similar to the FSM used for heap, in freespace.c, but instead
 *	of tracking the amount of free space on pages, we only track whether
 *	pages are completely free or in-use. We use the same FSM implementation
 *	as for heaps, using BLCKSZ - 1 to denote used pages, and 0 for unused.
