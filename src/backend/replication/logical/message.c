 *
 * NOTES
 *
 * Generic logical messages allow XLOG logging of arbitrary binary blobs that
 * get passed to the logical decoding plugin. In normal XLOG processing they
 * are same as NOOP.
 *
 * These messages can be either transactional or non-transactional.
 * Transactional messages are part of current transaction and will be sent to
 * decoding plugin using in a same way as DML operations.
 * Non-transactional messages are sent to the plugin at the time when the
 * logical decoding reads them from XLOG. This also means that transactional
 * messages won't be delivered if the transaction was rolled back but the
 * non-transactional one will always be delivered.
 *
 * Every message carries prefix to avoid conflicts between different decoding
 * plugins. The plugin authors must take extra care to use unique prefix,
 * good options seems to be for example to use the name of the extension.
