/*
 *	Selectivity functions for geometric operators.  These are bogus -- unless
 *	we know the actual key distribution in the index, we can't make a good
 *	prediction of the selectivity of these operators.
 *
 *	Note: the values used here may look unreasonably small.  Perhaps they
 *	are.  For now, we want to make sure that the optimizer will make use
 *	of a geometric index if one is available, so the selectivity had better
 *	be fairly small.
 *
 *	In general, GiST needs to search multiple subtrees in order to guarantee
 *	that all occurrences of the same key have been found.  Because of this,
 *	the estimated cost for scanning the index ought to be higher than the
 *	output selectivity would indicate.  gistcostestimate(), over in selfuncs.c,
 *	ought to be adjusted accordingly --- but until we can generate somewhat
 *	realistic numbers here, it hardly matters...
