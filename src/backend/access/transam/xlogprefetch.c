 *
 * The goal of this module is to read future WAL records and issue
 * PrefetchSharedBuffer() calls for referenced blocks, so that we avoid I/O
 * stalls in the main recovery loop.
 *
 * When examining a WAL record from the future, we need to consider that a
 * referenced block or segment file might not exist on disk until this record
 * or some earlier record has been replayed.  After a crash, a file might also
 * be missing because it was dropped by a later WAL record; in that case, it
 * will be recreated when this record is replayed.  These cases are handled by
 * recognizing them and adding a "filter" that prevents all prefetching of a
 * certain block range until the present WAL record has been replayed.  Blocks
 * skipped for these reasons are counted as "skip_new" (that is, cases where we
 * didn't try to prefetch "new" blocks).
 *
 * Blocks found in the buffer pool already are counted as "skip_hit".
 * Repeated access to the same buffer is detected and skipped, and this is
 * counted with "skip_seq".  Blocks that were logged with FPWs are skipped if
 * recovery_prefetch_fpw is off, since on most systems there will be no I/O
 * stall; this is counted with "skip_fpw".
 *
 * The only way we currently have to know that an I/O initiated with
 * PrefetchSharedBuffer() has completed is to wait for the corresponding call
 * to XLogReadBufferInRedo() to return.  Therefore, we track the number of
 * potentially in-flight I/Os by using a circular buffer of LSNs.  When it's
 * full, we have to wait for recovery to replay enough records to remove some
 * LSNs, and only then can we initiate more prefetching.  Ideally, this keeps
 * us just the right distance ahead to respect maintenance_io_concurrency,
 * though in practice it errs on the side of being too conservative because
 * many I/Os complete sooner than we know.
