Base on Btree
=============

This directory contains a copied implemention of btree files in 
src/backend/access/nbtree/. The ei functions are little bit changed from
bt functions. The remaining bt functions and structures are not changed but
the original are defined as a static. The modification of original function
is no good for maintenance. Thus same bt functions and structure are redefined.


The difference with Btree
--------------

The functions which has important difference are _ei_insert_parent, 
_ei_newroot and _ei_compare.

_ei_insert_parent and _ei_newroot calls _ei_reformTuple instead of
CopyIndexTuple. CopyIndexTuple returns complete index tuple from the item.
But _ei_reformTuple makes index tuple with first key of the item and
returns it.

_ei_compare fixes the key size to 1. The Edge index do not need to care
about order of second key. 

The other _ei_* functions are just calling these functions or caller of these
functions. That's all.
