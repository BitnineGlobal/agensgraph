Edge Indexing
=============

This directory contains almost the same implemention of nbtree, except for
intermediate index key creation and index key comparison.
Functions prefixed by "ei" are slightly changed from their original form.
Remaining functions and structures are not touched or not included because
they are either in static scope or in external scope but identical to the
original one. Since modifying such definitions makes hard to maintain codes,
same functions and structures are redefined.

Differences to the origianl nbtree
----------------------------------

Functions which have important differences are _ei_insert_parent(),
_ei_newroot(), and _ei_compare().

_ei_insert_parent() and _ei_newroot() calls _ei_reformTuple() instead of
CopyIndexTuple(). CopyIndexTuple() returns complete index tuple from an item.
But _ei_reformTuple() makes an index tuple which has only first key of an item.

_ei_compare() only compares first keys. The Edge Index do not need to care
about the order of second key.

Other _ei_* functions just call those functions or are caller of those
functions.
