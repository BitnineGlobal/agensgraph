-- This file is meant to contain aggregate functions that need to be created only
-- once and not recreated during updates.
-- There is no CREATE OR REPLACE AGGREGATE which means that the only way to replace
-- an aggregate is to DROP then CREATE which is problematic as it will fail
-- if the previous version of the aggregate has dependencies.
-- NOTE that WHEN CREATING NEW FUNCTIONS HERE you should also make sure they are
-- created in an update script so that both new users and people updating from a
-- previous version get the new function


--This aggregate returns the "first" element of the first argument when ordered by the second argument.
--Ex. first(temp, time) returns the temp value for the row with the lowest time
