How to create a pg_statsinfo RPM package.
=====================================

1. Create the work directories required by rpmbuild.

$ mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{BUILD,RPMS,SOURCES,SPECS,SRPMS}

2. Create the .rpmmacros file so that rpmbuild will use the
   directory above.

$ echo "%_topdir %(echo $HOME)/rpmbuild" > ~/.rpmmacros

3. Place files in the rpmbuild directory.

$ cp pg_statsinfo-X.X.X.tar.gz ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES
$ cp pg_statsinfo.spec ~/rpmbuild/SPECS

4. Edit the SPEC file as needed. The following two lines will be
   required to be changed.

$ vi ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/pg_statsinfo.spec
----------------------------------------
%define _pgdir   /usr/pgsql-9.4
BuildRequires:   postgresql94-devel
----------------------------------------

5. Run rpmbuild. "-bb" instructs to build a binary package.

$ rpmbuild -bb ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/pg_statsinfo.spec


Prerequisite packages.
